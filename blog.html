            <h2>Accomplish more with more accomplished robots</h2>
            <p>
              Robotic process automation (RPA) can help your business be more
              efficient, agile, and profitable. It can make customersвЂ™
              experiences richer by letting you serve them quickly, flexibly,
              and responsively. And put more joy in each employee's workday by
              taking repetitive routine out of it. RPA technology is already
              transforming businesses of all kinds as companies around the world
              become convinced of automationвЂ™s power and make it central to
              their strategies. TheyвЂ™ve embarked on their automation journey.
              And now itвЂ™s your time. How do you move forward? Where can your
              automation journey take you? The good news: thereвЂ™s no need to
              reinvent the wheel on this one. In working with thousands of
              customers to scale and implement RPA, weвЂ™ve seen what works and
              what doesnвЂ™t. And while the details may vary a bit, weвЂ™ve
              found that the most successful companies follow a 3-stage path:

          <h2>Orchestrator</h2>
          <p>
            Orchestrator is the heart of your automation management. It gives
            you the power to provision, deploy, trigger, monitor, measure,
            track, and ensure the security of every robot in your organization.
            So now you can manage everything from your browserвЂ”or your mobile
            device.
          </p>
          <p>
            With zero-touch provisioning, pluggable enterprise credential
            stores, and the power to deploy processes simply by adding users to
            Active Directory groups, scaling automation wonвЂ™t tax your
            operationsвЂ”or your operating budget.
