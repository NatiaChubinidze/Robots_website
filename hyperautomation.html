                Hyperautomation brings together several components of
                processвЂЇautomation, integrating tools and technologies that
                amplify the ability to automate work.вЂЇ
              </p>
              <p>
                It starts with robotic process automation (RPA) at its core, and
                expands automation capability with artificial intelligence (AI),
                process mining, analytics, and other advanced tools.вЂЇ
              </p>
              <p>
                The idea is toвЂЇautomate more and more knowledgeвЂЇwork,
                andвЂЇengage everyone in an organization to be part of the
                transformation.вЂЇ
              </p>
              <p>
                How is hyperautomation important for enterprises looking to
                scale automation much more effectively? WeвЂ™ve got a blog post
                here that explains it all.
