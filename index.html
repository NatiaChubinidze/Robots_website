              <h2>What is Robotic Process Automation?</h2>
              <p>
                Robotic Process Automation is the technology that allows anyone
                today to configure computer software, or a вЂњrobotвЂќ to
                emulate and integrate the actions of a human interacting within
                digital tems to execute a business process. RPA robots utilize
                the user interface to capture data and manipulate applications
                just like humans do. They interpret, trigger responses and
                communicate with other systems in order to perform on a vast
                variety of repetitive tasks. Only substantially better: an RPA
                software robot never sleeps and makes zero mistakes.

              How is RPA different from other enterprise automation tools?
            </h2>
            <p>
              In contrast to other, traditional IT solutions, RPA allows
              organizations to automate at a fraction of the cost and time
              previously encountered. RPA is also non-intrusive in nature and
              leverages the existing infrastructure without causing disruption
              to underlying systems, which would be difficult and costly to
              replace. With RPA, cost efficiency and compliance are no longer an
              operating cost but a byproduct of the automation.
