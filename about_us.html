        <h1>About the CoBots Corporation</h1>
        <p>
          We are the CoBots - Attended & Unattended Bots that help humans
          automate their repetitive work. Software robots are intelligent,
          reliable, flexible, and eager to take on a huge range of tedious
          tasks. We are also easy to build and manage, so you can launch an
          entire robot workforce to quickly deliver efficiencies, higher
          performance, and high ROI. We have great relationships with multiple
          platforms. TheyвЂ™re very cozy with enterprise applications like SAP,
          Salesforce, and Oracle, and office apps like Microsoft Office, to name
          just a few...
        </p>

        <p>There are three types of robots at our organization:</p>

            If you need some personal support, look no further. Attended robots
            await your direction. You do the decision-based work, and the robot
            does the rest.

            They work alone; people step in only when necessary. These robots
            handle advanced, task-heavy, long-running processes.

            Get the best of both worlds: finish daily tasks with the help of
            your attended robot and leave the unattended robot to compile
            reports overnight.

          HereвЂ™s just some of what we can handle: desktop, web, text-based
          data, Citrix, business apps, email, IT, Office, and, of course, human
          actions. Did we miss anything youвЂ™re looking for? Just ask.
